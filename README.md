# 🤖 Customer Support Chatbot 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Customer Support Chatbot** using **Google Dialogflow ES** and integrating it with **Telegram**. The chatbot is capable of understanding user queries using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and responding to common customer support questions automatically. It is designed to handle FAQs such as order-related queries, delivery status, return/exchange assistance, and support timings. It provides instant responses and improves user experience by offering 24/7 automated assistance.

## Objectives
- Build an intent-based chatbot using Dialogflow  
- Design structured and meaningful conversational flows  
- Integrate Dialogflow with Telegram using BotFather  
- Test the chatbot inside Dialogflow and Telegram  
- Maintain a reusable and professional project structure  

---

## Features
- Intent-based NLP conversation handling  
- Default welcome and fallback responses  
- Telegram bot integration  
- Real-time user interaction  
- Modular and reusable Dialogflow agent  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Dialogflow ES** – NLP and intent processing  
- **Telegram Bot API** – Messaging platform  
- **JSON** – Intents, entities, and agent configuration  
- **GitHub** – Version control  

---

## How It Works
1. The user sends a message via Telegram  
2. Telegram forwards the message to Dialogflow  
3. Dialogflow processes the input using NLP  
4. The most relevant intent is matched  
5. A predefined response is sent back to the user
